# Basketrunner

This is a **Subway Surfer inspired endless runner game**, developed in **Unity** as part of a **Mobile Game Development course**. The game is designed with dynamic gameplay mechanics, offering fast-paced action, engaging visual effects, and increasing difficulty as the player progresses.

### Features:

- **Three-Lane System**: Players can switch between three lanes to avoid obstacles and collect points.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Randomly spawning obstacles with physics-based interactions, allowing slicing and destruction.
- **Elemental Mechanics**: Enemies with unique elemental types (e.g., Fire, Water, Ice) requiring strategic counterattacks.
- **Combo Attack System**: Chain combo attacks with visual effects like fire, ice, and lightning to defeat enemies.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Game speed increases as the player scores more points, making the game progressively challenging.
- **High Score Tracking**: Save and track high scores between sessions for replayability.

### Technologies and Design:

- Developed in **Unity** using **C#** scripting.
- Features an **Object Pooling System** for efficient enemy and obstacle management.
- Designed with a **Modular Architecture**, utilizing **ScriptableObjects** for extensibility (e.g., Elemental Types, Attack Types).
- Mobile-friendly controls and optimized for performance.
